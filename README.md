# BookStart - find your next favorite book!
View the BookStart App Here: https://bookstart.netlify.app/ 
## Overall Concept
My overall goal for this application was to create a book search application utilizing the *Open Library API*. A search bar is the main point of contact, and receives author or title based searches. There is a browse function which currently features a selection of common book genres and themes, and books may also be found via those links. 
I created an initial mockup of the visual of the app using Figma. 
A screenshot of the homepage is below!

## The Open Library API
The open library API features thousands of books and book editions. I chose this API for the multitude of information it provided for each book. I am using Axios to pull this information in to my project via multiple API calls, as this API features different information at different endpoints.  

## Technologies Used:
This project was built using Axios, React, Javascript, and HTML/CSS and uses a variety of React Hooks, including useState, useContext, and useEffect, along with Routes and Links from the React Router DOM. I used Material Design Builder to assist with building a color palette for my application, as well as Google Fonts to import my font. I used Netfliy to deploy this app.
